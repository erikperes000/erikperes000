-I am an intermediate developer with productions focused on the world of digital games.

-I have experience - accumulated over more than 3 years - in: programming (still at an intermediate level); high-level musical composition; development of large projects; design for fictional works and construction of works with good plots. My main focus of productions has been, so far, 2D and pseudo-3D games.

-This world of interests, which led to my professional training, began in my early years of life, a condition that makes my personal projects one of the most inseparable things of my personal characterization.

- Thanks!!! :guitar:
